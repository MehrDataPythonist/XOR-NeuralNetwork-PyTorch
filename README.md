# XOR-NeuralNetwork-PyTorch
A simple XOR problem solved with a neural network implemented in PyTorch.
# XOR Neural Network in PyTorch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network to solve the XOR problem using PyTorch.

## Code Features:
- A two-layer neural network with a hidden layer of 4 neurons.
- Sigmoid activation functions for both the hidden and output layers.
- Binary Cross Entropy Loss for training the model.

## How to Run:
1. Install PyTorch: `pip install torch`.
2. Run the script: `python xor_nn.py`.

## Output:
The network is trained for 5000 epochs and successfully predicts the XOR outputs.
